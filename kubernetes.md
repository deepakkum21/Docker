# KUBERNETES

## 1.Nodes:-

- A node is a `machine – physical or virtual – on which kubernetes is installed`.
- A node is a worker machine and this is `were containers will be launched` by kubernetes

## Master:-

- The master is `another node with Kubernetes installed in it`, and is configured as a Master.
- The master `watches over the nodes in the cluster` and is `responsible for the actual orchestration of containers` on the worker nodes.
